# skip-selector-redesign
This project is a full redesign of the skip selection page from WeWantWaste. It keeps all the original features but with a new, modern look. The page is responsive and works well on both mobile and desktop. Skip options are loaded from this API: https://app.wewantwaste.co.uk/api/skips/by-location?postcode=NR32&amp;area=Lowestoft
